mask and distanciation detector with Jetson nano


Iam using here NVIDIA jetson nano 4GB version B01 (2GB will work same) with raspberry pi camera v2 (aspberry pi camera v1 do not work with jetson nano!) and a wifi adapter (you can use any other wifi source like ethernet); see the setup on 'image'




1.First you have to install libraries on python found on 'libraries'

2.You have to creat a folder of known persons (that you will recognize if detected not wearing mask), and rename each photo with the name of the person. Then go to 'trainSave.py' and run the code on python (you will find some explenation with the code)

3.Then you will be ready to run the whole code (you can find it on 'pythonCode.py')



Any questions leave them on comments and I will be glad to answer you.
